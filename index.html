        <h2>Rhonaldo Foster</h2>
        <p>My name is Rhonaldo Foster, a third year student pursuing a software engineering degree at UWI Mona campus. I enjoy playing football and reading novels in my spear time. My favourite dessert is chocolate ice cream and twizzlers. My reason to do web dev is that i thought it would be fun to learn, develop and design webpages/websites of my own.</p>
